VARN Gaming Website
This is a real-time application-oriented project for a gaming website, developed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The project aims to provide a comprehensive, engaging platform for gamers, offering the latest news, reviews, and a vibrant community.

Project Description
The VARN Gaming Website is designed to be the ultimate hub for all things gaming. It features a modern, responsive interface and integrates classic puzzle games directly into the site. The core mission is to enhance the gaming experience by providing valuable content, fostering a strong community, and offering an intuitive, user-friendly platform.

Features
Responsive Design: The website is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring an optimal viewing and gaming experience on all devices.

Integrated Games: Playable versions of classic games like Sudoku and Tetris are included directly on the site.

Community Reviews: Users can submit and view community reviews for various games via a dedicated form and modal.

Dynamic Search: A search bar on the "Games" page allows users to quickly filter and find games.

Simulated Chatbot: A floating chatbot icon provides a front-end interface for a 24/7 support system, as outlined in the project's future scope.

Clean UI/UX: The interface is designed with a dark, modern aesthetic to create an immersive and visually appealing experience.

Technologies Used
This project is built using a modern web development stack focused on performance and maintainability.

Astro.js: A next-generation web framework that ships less JavaScript, resulting in incredibly fast-loading websites.

HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: The foundational web technologies for structuring content, styling the interface, and adding interactive functionality.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and consistent styling.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard Astro.js file structure, with separate components, layouts, and pages to promote modularity and reusability.
